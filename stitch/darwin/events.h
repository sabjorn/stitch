/*! \brief Generic representation of all kinds of event sources.

There are two basic kinds of events, both of which are represented
by the Event class:
- Momentary: Representing momentary occurrences, such as an elapsed point in time.
- Conditional: Representing an ongoing condition, such as a FIFO file having data to read.

An event can be in one of two states: active or inactive.
Methods like \ref wait and \ref Event_Reactor::run, which are
called "handlers", observe and modify this state.

A momentary event becomes active when the underlying moment occurs (e.g. a timer expires),
and is immediately deactivated by a handler.
A conditional event becomes active when the underlying condition begins
(e.g. a FIFO file becomes ready to read)
and is deactivated by handlers only after the condition ends
(e.g. all data in the file is read and there is no more data to read).

    /*! \brief Monitors event activations and invokes subscribed callbacks.

      The \p mode parameter has the following effect:

      - NoWait: Handles each currently active event once and returns without waiting at all.
      - Wait: If no event with a subscription is currently active,
        waits until at least one is activated, handles each active event once and returns.
      - WaitUntilQuit: Keeps handling all active events until \ref quit is called,
        at which point it returns immediately.

      This method is "fair" in the following sense.
      It handles each active event once
      before handling the same event again.

      "Handling" an active event means invoking the subscribed callback
      and deactivating momentary events.

      It is safe to throw an exception from a callback. Exceptions are
      simply propagated by the `run` method.
      Apart from that, throwing an exception has the same effect
      as calling \ref quit from a callback.
